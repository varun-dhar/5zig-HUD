# 5zig-HUD
A simple HUD and mapping mod for 1.16.3-1.16.5 somewhat inspired by [The5zigMod](https://github.com/5zig-reborn/The-5zig-Mod).

Includes coordinates, FPS, direction, armor durability, after-death item despawn timer, death location coordinates, coordinate mapping, macros, a navigation system, and actions, as well as commands for managing these features.

# Demo

# Usage
To use, simply place the mod in the mods folder and launch Forge. After the first run, configuration files for 5zig-HUD will be created in the mods folder. Using these files, and/or well as the commands, you can customize the features of the mod. To load new changes, the mod must be reloaded by exiting Minecraft and relaunching. Changes made with commands do not require a reload. Further usage instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/doggo4242/5zig-HUD/wiki)

# Side notes
The death location coordinates will be overwritten if one dies before the timer elapses. You can dump the coordinates to chat using commands. Command docs [here](https://github.com/doggo4242/5zig-HUD/wiki).
